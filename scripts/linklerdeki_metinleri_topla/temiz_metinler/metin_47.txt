Essex Police says it will bring anyone to justice who commits violence against women. Assistant Chief Constable Rachel Nolan said "we do listen" to victims. This comes after reality TV contestant Stephen Bear was jailed for 21 months for sharing a private video of him having sex with his ex-partner, Georgia Harrison.

Bear was found guilty of voyeurism and disclosing private, sexual photographs and films in December. He was given a restraining order to not contact Ms Harrison for five years and was also ordered to sign the sex offenders register and will be subject to notification requirements for 10 years.

ACC Nolan praised Ms Harrison for speaking out and said the investigation into the Bear case "left no stone unturned". She said the police force will find and bring to justice anyone committing violence against women and girls across Essex, regardless of their celebrity status.

Ms Nolan also called on social media companies to reflect on their permissiveness and the role they play in allowing such content to be shared without consent. She hoped that victims would listen to Ms Harrison's experience and take action.
