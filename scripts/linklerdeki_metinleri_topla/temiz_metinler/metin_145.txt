Ellen Roome, 14-year-old Jools Sweeney's mother, suspects her son died while taking part in a "blackout challenge" on social media. However, she can't access his online accounts, so she has given up everything to take on the social media giants.

Jools died on April 13, 2022, after a fun-filled day with friends. His mother had been in constant contact with him, but when she arrived home, she found him unresponsive. Despite CPR and defibrillation, Jools was pronounced dead.

The police investigation was inconclusive, and Jools' phone, iPad, and computer were taken but not examined. Roome believes that if Jools had been murdered, there would have been a more thorough investigation.

Roome has spent the last two years searching for the truth, trying to understand what happened to her son. She wants a national system in place where a coroner can immediately request social media companies to preserve a child's data in cases of sudden death.

Roome has become a member of the Bereaved Families for Online Safety group, which has campaigned for legislative change through the Online Safety Act and the data (use and access) bill. She has also lobbied MPs and met with social media companies, but they have refused to release Jools' data without a court order.

Roome has sold her business and is now suing TikTok for her son's alleged wrongful death, alongside three other parents who believe their children died while taking part in an online blackout challenge. She is determined to get answers and hold social media companies accountable.
