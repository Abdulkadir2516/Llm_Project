Here is the simplified news article:

A new report by Ofcom and Kick It Out has found that online abuse directed at people in sport is getting worse and is having a "devastating impact" on their lives, livelihoods, and families.

One anonymous respondent said they had even barricaded themselves inside their house for a week for fear of who they might meet outside, while others spoke of the damage done by threats made to themselves or their families.

Azeem Rafiq, who spoke out about racism at Yorkshire County Cricket Club, said the abuse he received had damaged his life to such an extent that he's not sure he'll ever be able to quantify it. He received messages saying he was a "Dirty P-word", that he should "Fuck off back to Pakistan", and that "All Muslims are bombers".

Former rugby referee Wayne Barnes said that while he could cope with abuse suggesting that he should be hanged, it was a different story when it was directed at his wife. He said misogynistic language aimed at his wife, including comments like "You fucking bitch! You slut! Tell your husband he's shit" and, at times, threats of sexual violence.

The report also spoke to sport stars, who said abuse had the potential to affect their performance, as well as presenters who said they often self-censored because of online hate.

Kick It Out's Sanjay Bhandari said the report showed that abuse of people in sport had become "normalised". "The impact of online abuse is undeniable, and the rise in discriminatory social media reports to Kick It Out last season shows it's getting worse," he said.

Jessica Zucker, online safety director at Ofcom, said social media platforms needed to be more proactive in protecting users. "So many people who work in sport are subjected to vile abuse online," she said. "This is having a devastating impact on them, their livelihoods and their families, and no one should have to put up with it."
