Everton have condemned "threatening, racist, and misogynistic" abuse aimed towards the wife of Dominic Calvert-Lewin. Sandra Calvert-Lewin received online abuse after posting a message in support of her husband, who played his final game at Goodison Park in Sunday's 2-0 win over Southampton.

The club said: "Everton Football Club strongly condemns the threatening, racist, and misogynistic abuse directed towards the wife of Dominic Calvert-Lewin on social media. This sinister and intimidating behaviour is not only deeply hurtful and distressing, it is also criminal - and does not represent the values of Everton or the overwhelming majority of our supporters.

"The club has a zero-tolerance policy towards all forms of discriminatory and abusive behaviour. We are working closely with Merseyside Police and the Premier League to ensure the individuals responsible are identified and held accountable for their actions.

"Threats or abuse of any kind - whether online or in person - are completely unacceptable and have no place in our game or in society. The club urges anyone who sees or experiences such behaviour to report it to the authorities and relevant social media platforms immediately.

In response, Merseyside Police said: "We are aware of racist and threatening social media comments directed towards the wife of Dominic Calvert-Lewin. To send such abhorrent messages to anyone online is utterly appalling and we are working with Everton Football Club as part of our initial enquiries.
