Here is the simplified news article:

Meta and Pinterest have reportedly made significant donations to the Molly Rose Foundation, a charity set up to campaign for internet safety. The foundation was set up in the name of 14-year-old Molly Russell, who took her own life in 2017 after viewing harmful material linked to suicide and self-harm on social media platforms.

The foundation’s latest annual report refers to grants received from donors who wish to remain anonymous. According to the BBC, these payments are believed to have been made by Meta and Pinterest since 2024 and are expected to continue over a number of years.

The Russell family have not received any money from the donation. Instead, they will pursue the aims of the Molly Rose Foundation to help ensure young people have a positive experience online.

The reported donations come as social media companies face increased criticism over the impact of online platforms on children’s mental health. The Molly Rose Foundation has launched campaigns urging the government to strengthen the Online Safety Act and place more responsibility on technology companies for content promoted through algorithms.
