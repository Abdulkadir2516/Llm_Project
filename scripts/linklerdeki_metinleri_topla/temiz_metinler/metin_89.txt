Online bullying, violence, and paedophilia have made young people sceptical of unfettered access to technology.

Izzy Bouric, 24, said: "Everyone from my generation has an experience of being on chatrooms and getting solicited by someone much, much older."

Sophie, 18, a student at the University of Edinburgh, wouldn't allow her children to have a smartphone until they're adults. "As a teen I would have been the biggest advocate on everyone having a phone, but I've 100% changed my opinion," she said.

Social media fuelled bullying at Sophie's school, including competing for likes and using anonymous confession apps to share cruel comments.

Izzy Bouric thinks part of the problem is the way the boundaries between child and adult spaces have blurred on platforms such as Instagram, TikTok, and Roblox in recent years.

Tobias, 20, from Austria, received his first smartphone aged 11 or 12, and noticed a change in his classmates. "You just sat down and started scrolling and you didn’t really talk to the person one row behind you, you texted them."

Lethe, 20, a student paramedic from near Birmingham, England, wouldn’t allow her child to have a smartphone until they were 16 and would only allow restricted media access.

Nora, 23, a project manager from Spain, wouldn’t allow social media access until age 13 and would restrict use and install content filters, although she would want to open a dialogue with her child, explaining the risks.
