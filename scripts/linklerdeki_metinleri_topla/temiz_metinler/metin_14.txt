Kent's police and crime commissioner, Matthew Scott, will answer questions on BBC Radio Kent on Thursday. Women's safety and online bullying will be among the topics discussed. This month, Kent Police released a video about violence against women and girls with Kent County Council and the Kent and Medway Violence Reduction unit. A survey from Mr Scott's office in February said about a third of children had been bullied online. Mr Scott has said that it is important to talk about the problems that social media, smartphones, and online bullying are causing to young people.
