Here is the simplified news article:

Three men gather in an online forum to speak of women as bitches and “Beckys”. These are “incels”, who boast a coded vocabulary of hate and valorise male celibacy. That is, until a fourth man among them has sex. The opening scene is the morning after and the woman he spent the night with stands hovering behind his laptop.

Cuckboy and fellow incels Ghost and Crusher are volubly and virulently anti-women. “Feminists have destroyed male and female courtship,” says one. But gradually they are shown to be desperate for intimacy, once the itch has been scratched by Cuckboy’s hookup with Margaret.

The play, written and directed by Jamie Sykes, takes the high-stakes decision to eke laughter from a culture based on hate and sometimes murderous terror. And on the whole it succeeds.

The script sometimes elicits sympathy for these men, some of whom were terribly bullied boys once; all of whom are evidently lonely, inadequate outsiders. Their contempt for women turns your stomach but their loathing is turned inwards too, with graphic self-hatred, depression, and an almost fetished attitude towards suicide.

The actors give thoroughly fabulous performances, and the show includes breakouts of music and movement that archly reflect the men’s sexual frustration in dance, then turn into expressions of inner turmoil with wavy-armed Kate Bush-style emoting.

Margaret is a journalist who wants to find out what makes these men tick. She makes all the intellectual counter-challenging arguments against inceldom, throwing the Magdalene laundries and Irish laws around contraception into the mix, as well as bringing in the story of her brother, too briefly. The men threaten to dox her and it is a potentially terrifying moment.

The ending does not have the punch it might, yet this play is gripping, queasily entertaining, and shows clear signs of arresting originality.
