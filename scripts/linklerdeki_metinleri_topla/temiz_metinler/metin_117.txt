Here is the simplified news article:

David, a 46-year-old father from Calgary, Canada, initially didn't see a problem when his 10-year-old son started playing on Roblox. However, he soon discovered that a man from India had approached his son on the platform and coached him to bypass their internet security controls. The man then persuaded David's son to take compromising nude images and videos of himself and send them via their Google Mini.

Many parents have shared similar concerns about their children's experiences on Roblox, including addiction, exposure to harmful content, grooming, emotional blackmail, bullying, and strangers talking inappropriately to their children on the platform.

Research by digital behavior experts Revealing Reality found that children as young as five were able to communicate with adults while playing games on the platform. Roblox acknowledged that children playing on the platform may be exposed to harmful content and "bad actors," but said it was working hard to fix the issue.

Parents have expressed concerns about the difficulty of navigating the parental control settings and the impossibility of verifying the age of users. Many have also reported that their children have become addicted to the platform, losing interest in other activities in the real world.

Roblox has announced a series of additional safety tools, but many parents remain unconvinced. The company has acknowledged that age verification for users under the age of 13 remains a wider industry challenge.
