Wimbledon is targeting a younger audience with a volley of themed games, apps, and clothing lines. The All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club (AELTC) is launching a new online game, "Race to Wimbledon", on Fortnite, featuring Andy Murray. The club is also introducing an upgraded "WimbleWorld" experience on Roblox, a tennis app called "Wimbledon Smash", and a collaboration with "Tennis Clash", a leading mobile game.

The club's digital product arm wants to engage with new people and involve core elements like the grass and strawberries and cream, as well as the tennis itself. Revenue from the games will be invested in youth tennis.

Players of "Race to Wimbledon" will speed to Centre Court on foot, by road and air, while the Roblox platform offers younger gamers the chance to mow the grass and paint the baseline in "WimbleWorld". The club hopes that video gaming will develop new fans of the championship, even if they don't play tennis themselves.

The Wimbledon brand is also reaching young people via fashion, with a new "semi-formal" capsule wardrobe of outfits sold exclusively online. The club is building on a wider trend for sporty looks, dubbed tenniscore.
