More than 150 professionals have gathered in Inverness for Highland Child Protection Committee's annual conference. This year's event has a particular focus on the online safety of children and young people. It follows warnings from communications watchdog Ofcom that 59% of 13 to 17-year-olds have seen potentially harmful content online.

HCPC lead officer Donna Munro said: "It does not matter if you live in London or you live in Thurso or Farr - children could be at risk on the internet if they are not supported, if we don't put mitigations in place."

Ofcom has finalised a series of child safety rules for social media, search, gaming apps and websites, which are due to come into force next month. The measures are designed to prevent young people from encountering the most harmful content online relating to suicide, self-harm, eating disorders and pornography.

The regulator estimates that children aged eight to 17 spend between two and five hours a day online.
