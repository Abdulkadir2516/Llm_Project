Adele Zeynep Walton's sister Aimee was a talented artist who loved music. After Aimee's death, Walton discovered that her sister had been lured into a dangerous online community that promoted suicide. Walton pieced together that Aimee had spent time on a pro-suicide forum, where she learned how to procure the substance that killed her and met a man who accompanied her while she died.

Walton is now a campaigner for online safety and has written a book, "Logging Off: The Human Cost of Our Digital World", which tells her sister's story and highlights the dangers of the unregulated digital world. She believes that the online community Aimee was part of is a type of radicalization that encourages extreme actions, and that the digital world is a warped distortion of the offline world that intensifies its pitfalls and maximizes its risks.

Walton hopes that the coroner investigating Aimee's death will take into account the online factors that contributed to her death, and that the government will take action to regulate the digital world and prevent similar tragedies from occurring. She also hopes that her book will raise awareness about the dangers of the digital world and encourage people to take action to protect themselves and others.
