Senior UK police officers have called for the government to ban children under 16 from social media, amid claims the platforms are “fuelling and enabling” crime.

Four senior officers say more controls are needed, citing concerns over public safety, national security, and young people’s mental health.

Sarah Crew, chief constable of Avon and Somerset, said social media platforms were putting children at risk of exploitation and abuse. “Young people are by their nature vulnerable, and this gives those perpetrators who would want to do harm a really direct channel,” she said.

Maggie Blyth, acting chief constable of Gloucestershire, claimed that social media was “a significant threat not just to our children and young people but also to our society”. Blyth added: “We are seeing young people acting out violence and behaviour like strangulation because they see it online. There are horrific things that are being normalised.”

Tim De Meyer, chief constable of Surrey police, said he was positive that social media is “fuelling and enabling crime”, arguing a ban for under-16s was crucial.

Matt Jukes, the police head of counter-terrorism, pointed out that 20% of those arrested for terrorist offences last year were children. “Terrorist groups are now able to radicalise, to share instructions, to share their ideologies,” he said.

Neil Basu, a former assistant commissioner of the Metropolitan police, was also keen on banning social media for children. “I hear a lot of arguments that there is no connection between violent imagery and people committing violence. I don’t believe that for a moment after 30 years of policing … The idea that that has no effect seems utterly facile to me. So ban it, yes, and 16 seems reasonable to me.”
