Northern Ireland MP Sorcha Eastwood told the House of Commons how she was targeted by Andrew Tate and his followers for speaking out against Elon Musk online. Eastwood spoke to MPs during a debate on digital platforms' impact on democracy in which she shared her own experience with online hate and death threats.

"We have seen a deliberate, organised effort to create an environment where extremism flourishes, intimidation becomes the norm and women, minorities and political opponents are driven out of public life," she said.
