Britain's media regulator, Ofcom, on Tuesday launched nine investigations into the internet message board 4chan as well as several file-sharing services over possible breaches of online safety laws.

The regulator said it had received complaints about potential illegal content on 4chan and, separately, possible sharing of child sexual abuse material on seven file-sharing services.

Ofcom is investigating whether 4chan and the file-sharing services failed to put in place appropriate safety measures to protect users from illegal content and to respond to a statutory information request. It also wants to assess whether they kept proper risk assessment records.

The regulator can require platforms to take specific measures to ensure compliance with the rules, or fine them up to £18m ($24.3m) or 10% of qualifying worldwide revenue, whichever is greater.

Ofcom’s announcement also said it was investigating whether First Time Videos, which provides pornographic services, has effective enough age assurance in place to protect children.
