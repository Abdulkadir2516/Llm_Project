Lawyers for a former reality TV personality say she has been granted record damages after her ex-partner shared a private sexual video without her consent. Stephen Bear, from Essex, was jailed for 21 months after being found guilty of sharing the film online. Georgia Harrison's solicitors said she was awarded Â£207,900 in compensation damages at the High Court on Wednesday. Ms Harrison, 28, said she would donate part of the sum to charities.

Bear and Ms Harrison were recorded on CCTV having sex in his garden in Loughton in August 2020. Bear appeared on Celebrity Big Brother in 2016 and Ms Harrison has appeared on TV shows The Only Way Is Essex, Love Island and Olivia Meets Her Match. A trial at Chelmsford Crown Court in December heard he uploaded the footage to social media site OnlyFans "either himself" or asked someone else to do it so he "profited financially".
