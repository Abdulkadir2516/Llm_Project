Trade unions are becoming increasingly concerned by a rise in “racist and bigoted” comments online from their own members and officials, the new leader of the Fire Brigades Union has told the Guardian.

Steve Wright, the general secretary of the FBU, said internal inquiries into allegations of racism have uncovered dozens of cases where members have been found to use racist slurs or stereotypes, often regarding asylum seekers.

Other unions have had similar incidents, he said. Together, a group of unions plan to launch a campaign warning that online populists and far-right organisations are distorting the truth about immigration and race.

“People with far-right views are becoming more brazen in what they do on social media, and I’ve witnessed it with my own union around disciplinary cases and the rhetoric of some of our own members,” Wright said.

At the FBU’s annual conference in Blackpool next month, Wright will launch a statement calling for unions to counter far-right organisations and warn that they are distorting the truth about immigration and race.

He blamed social media and the rise of far right and populist movements for emboldening some union members with anti-immigrant views to make racist comments online.

The FBU, usually regarded as one of Labour’s most leftwing affiliated unions, barred a former member of its governing body in November for allegedly making racist posts online.

Incidents of racism and misogyny at the London fire service were exposed more than two years ago by an inquiry into the culture of the UK’s largest rescue organisation.
