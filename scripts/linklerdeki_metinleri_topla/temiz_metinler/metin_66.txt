Beeban Kidron, a film-maker and life peer, has been warning of the digital dangers facing young people since 2012. She has pushed through a Children's Code that hopes to change the landscape for ever. The Age Appropriate Design Code, an amendment to the 2018 Data Protection Act, came into effect this month. It requires online services to "put the best interests of the child first" when designing apps, games, websites and internet-connected toys that are "likely" to be used by kids.

The code has 15 standards that companies need to adhere to in order to avoid being fined up to 4% of their global turnover. These include offering "bite-size" terms and conditions for children; giving them "high privacy" by default; turning off geolocation and profiling; and avoiding "nudge techniques" that encourage children to turn off privacy settings.

Kidron's code has led to changes in tech companies, such as Instagram preventing adults from messaging children who don't follow them on the app, and YouTube turning off autoplay for users aged 13-17. However, Kidron notes that there are still flaws in the plan, such as the fact that kids can lie about their age to access online services.

Kidron is working on a private member's bill that sets minimum standards of age assurance, preventing companies from choosing their own "intrusive, heavy handed or just terrible, lousy, and ineffective" techniques. She believes that tech companies are "disordering the world" with their algorithms and that the Children's Code is just the beginning of a larger conversation about regulating the online environment.
