Roblox gives parents more power over children’s activity on gaming platform. Parents can now block their children from communicating with specific friends or playing certain games on Roblox, an online gaming platform popular with children.

The changes form part of a suite of safety updates intended to give parents more control over their child’s experience on the platform. From Wednesday, parents and caregivers who identify themselves with an ID or credit card will have access to three new tools.

The friend management tool means they can block anyone on their child’s friends list, preventing their child from exchanging direct messages with that account, and report people they believe are violating Roblox policies. They can also review and change the content maturity level for their child’s account, determining which games their child can access, and obtain detailed screen-time insights.

Under the Online Safety Act, which came into force this year, tech companies must tackle harmful content on their platforms or face fines of up to £18m or 10% of global revenue. There have been reports of bullying and grooming on Roblox and fears that children are being exposed to explicit or harmful content on the site.

Roblox’s chief safety officer, Matt Kaufman, said safety was at the company’s core and its mission was to be “the safest and most civil online platform in the world”. The US-based company is one of the world’s largest games platforms, with more monthly users than Nintendo Switch and Sony PlayStation combined.

Andy Burrows, the chief executive of the Molly Rose Foundation, said he welcomed the safety improvements but that “Roblox still needs to get to grips with substantial problems with harmful and age-inappropriate content”.
