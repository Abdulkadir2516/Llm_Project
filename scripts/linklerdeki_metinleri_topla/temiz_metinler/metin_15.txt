Semina Halliwell, a 12-year-old girl, died after taking a fatal overdose. An inquest heard that Semina had a complex social history and was exceptionally vulnerable. She had been depressed and withdrawn in the months leading up to her death.

Semina's mother, Rachel Halliwell, said that her daughter was a quirky child who loved singing and dancing. However, after an older boy began messaging her on Snapchat, Semina's behavior changed. She started self-harming and was diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder.

Semina told her mother that she had been sexually assaulted by an older boy in the woods. The family reported the incident to the police, but they felt that the authorities did not support Semina appropriately. The police told Semina that it would be a complicated case and that it could take 18 months to come to court.

After Semina told her mother about the assault, she began to receive bullying messages on Snapchat. A campaign of bullying against Semina began, including videos of her being attacked by groups of girls. Semina's mother said that the bullying was horrendous and that her daughter couldn't cope.

Semina's aunt said that the only people who were helping her were her mother and herself, but they weren't qualified. The family felt that the authorities failed to prevent Semina's death.

In the days leading up to her death, Semina's social media posts became increasingly concerning. She said she had "no feeling" and felt "ruined as a person". On the night she took the overdose, Semina told her mother that she had "had enough". Her mother assumed she meant she was fed up with the police being there and the wider situation.

The coroner concluded that Semina's death was a tragic event, but that none of the authorities who dealt with her could have prevented her death. The family has made 13 complaints to Merseyside Police about its handling of the allegation of rape made by Semina.
