Here is the simplified news article:

The EU executive has launched an investigation into four pornographic websites over alleged failure to prevent children from seeing adult content. After analysis of company policies, the European Commission accused Pornhub, Stripchat, XNXX, and XVideos of failing to have effective age verification measures to stop minors accessing their content.

The investigation was opened under the EU's Digital Services Act, a wide-ranging law to combat online harms, including disinformation, cyber-attacks, hate speech, and the sale of fake goods. The act also includes tough provisions to protect children online, including preventing damage to mental health caused by seeing adult content.

According to the commission, all four platforms had one-click self-declarations to verify age, which it deemed ineffective to prevent under-18s from viewing adult content.

The platforms could resolve the investigation by producing forms of age verification deemed effective by EU regulators. But if the complaint is upheld, they could be fined up to 6% of global annual turnover.

The parent company of Pornhub said it was aware of the commission's investigation and "fully committed" to ensuring the safety of minors online.
