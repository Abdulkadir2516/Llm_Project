Here is the simplified news text:

Elon Musk apologized for some tweets this week. It's embarrassing for Earth's primo edgelord to do something so conventional. Imagine owning the world's premier shitposting platform and then shuffling sheepishly on to your own pixels to mumble something about having gone "too far" with your hurty words.

Elon's apology related to last week's spectacular online beef that he'd started with US president Donald Trump over the latter's OBBB. The two men were not able to directly confront each other, each feeling that they could only engage on their own platforms – X in Musk's case, Truth Social in Trump's.

This week was all about the apology, which should be a defining moment in man's – and woman's – understanding of precisely the pitfalls of being extremely online. It's extraordinary to think that social media didn't meaningfully exist 20 years ago, but has – in that very short span – now hurtled toward the spectacle of the world's richest man functioning as a warning about what can happen to anyone if they spend way too much time on it.

Spending lots of time and energy on social media platforms simply means you work for the guys who own them. For free. Whether this week's cautionary tale starring one of those very guys will shake humanity out of its potentially fatal attention spiral is, regrettably, doubtful in the extreme. But after watching Musk act like someone tearfully trying to de-cancel themself, no one can say the message of the spectacle was anything less than sledgehammer: delete your account, sir.
