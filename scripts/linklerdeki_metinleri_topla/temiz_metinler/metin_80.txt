Here is the simplified news text:

Content creators are expected to see their revenue through ads, brand deals and sponsorships increase by 20% this year. User-generated material will surpass advertising income from professional media companies, marking a "huge cultural shift" for the media world.

Content creators are expected to see their revenue increase by 20% this year, according to an assessment by WPP Media. It is expected to more than double to $376.6bn by 2030.

In 2025, for the first time, more than half of content-driven advertising revenue will come from user-generated platforms and content rather than professionally produced content.

The findings bring home the rapid change that global media is experiencing as users turn to digital platforms, via smartphones. The report said the shift was "profoundly impacting" the media world.

Senior industry figures from across television, podcasting and media have told the Guardian that YouTube in particular has become the central plumbing of the media world, taking a share of ad revenue for the content it hosts.

The profound shifts have also ensured that media traditionally reliant on advertising has been battling to hold on to that income, as well as cutting costs elsewhere.
