Here is the simplified news article:

Georgia Harrison, a reality TV star, says she was "living in fear" that more footage from an explicit video shared without her consent would be released. Her ex-partner, Stephen Bear, was jailed for 21 months after being found guilty of voyeurism and sharing private sexual videos online. Bear had used CCTV cameras in his garden to capture them having sex and then sent it to a friend and sold the video online - none of which she consented to. Harrison said seeing the footage on subscription site OnlyFans was "the final straw" for her. She feared Bear would sell even more footage. Harrison started criminal proceedings against Bear in December 2020 and said the process of going to court was tough but "empowering". Bear was given a restraining order to not contact Harrison for five years and was ordered to sign the sex offenders' register. Harrison said incidents like this are actually "such a common thing" and she receives messages from at least five women going through a similar situation every day. She is calling on the government to remove the requirement to prove intent from the law, making it easier to convict suspected perpetrators.
