Laura Murtagh, an independent councillor on Falkirk Council, has received violent threats over her proposal for a 15.6% council tax rise. She told the BBC's Scotcast podcast that she had suffered "overwhelming" online abuse since putting forward the motion. Some messages said the councillor should get "a kicking" for the proposal, while other abuse came from people Ms Murtagh knows personally.

Ms Murtagh defended the increase, saying it would help protect education services in the area. She said the difference between the proposed 13.7% rise and her 15.6% rise would be 50p a week for people in Band E properties.

The councillor said she was "physically sick" after putting forward the motion and left "crying my eyes out" about it. She also revealed that the abuse had affected her family and that she had urged her teenage daughter to ignore any comments she heard at school.

Councils across Scotland have introduced above-inflation rises this year, after years of the tax being frozen or capped. Local authorities have consistently argued that they needed more funding to pay for public services, such as community facilities and maintaining roads.
