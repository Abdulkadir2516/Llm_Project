Parents across London need to be aware of the signs their child could be vulnerable to radicalisation or being drawn into violent extremism, Met Police say. The force said it was issuing advice after Netflix drama Adolescence sparked a debate about misogyny and involuntary celibate (incel) ideology online.

Det Supt Jane Corrigan, the Met's Prevent co-ordinator for London, said: "While it's a fictitious drama, the story is grounded in a reality that we are seeing more and more in our work within Counter Terrorism Policing."

She added it was important that parents and carers were not "fooled into thinking that this is something that only happens to others". The Met said its counter terrorism officers had been "concerned for some time over the increasing numbers of young people being radicalised".

Det Supt Corrigan said parents should make themselves actively aware of what their children were doing online and talking to them about risks. "Young people are being referred to us, and in almost every instance a big part of their vulnerability is coming from what they are doing, seeing and consuming online," she said.

Met figures showed 2023 and 2024 were the highest two years on record for terrorism arrests of children aged 17, with 43 and 39 such arrests respectively compared to 12 arrests in 2019. Its Prevent referral figures showed almost 60% of referrals in the 2023-24 year related to those aged 17 and under, up from 50% in 2016-17.
