Teenage girls' TikTok skincare regimes offer little to no benefit, research shows. Skincare regimes demonstrated by young influencers on TikTok offer little to no benefit, researchers have found, saying that on the contrary they raise the risk of skin irritations and lifelong allergies in children.

The study reveals the skincare regimes involved six products on average, often from the same brands, with a total average cost of more than £120. The researchers found all but one of the 82 creators were girls, and their age ranged from seven to 18 years old.

The study found many of the ingredients in the featured products, such as citric acid, carry a risk of skin irritation and sun sensitivity – meaning they increase the chance of sunburn and other skin damage. Yet only 26% of the 84 videos showing daytime skincare routines included a sunscreen – something that authors called “a significant missed opportunity”.

The researchers found that among the 25 top-viewed videos, 76% contained at least one potential contact allergen – often fragrance. Prof Tess McPherson of the British Association of Dermatologists said the study was important, backing up anecdotal reports of an increase in young people attending clinics with skin irritation.

McPherson said she was aware of young people asking for birthday money to put towards expensive skincare products, many of which were being targeted at young girls through appealing packaging. As well as the risks highlighted by the study, McPherson said the skincare videos contributed to an increase in stigma around conditions such as acne and eczema as well as a fear of ageing.
