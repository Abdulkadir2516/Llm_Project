Jess Davies, 32, was 15 when a boy leaked nude photos of her, which spread around her school and town. She became a glamour model at 18, but was later violated again when a man took a photo of her while she slept and shared it with his friends. Davies' book, No One Wants to See Your D*ck, explores the dark corners of the manosphere, where men share and discuss explicit images of women without their consent.

Davies' experiences led her to campaign against online abuse and harassment. She has seen how men's online behavior can be normalized and accepted, and how women are often blamed and shamed for the actions of men. Davies believes that men need to be held accountable for their actions and that there needs to be a shift in the way society views and addresses online abuse.

Davies' book also explores the ways in which men's online behavior can be harmful, including the use of AI apps to create fake nude images of women and the sharing of explicit images without consent. She argues that these behaviors are not just the actions of a few individuals, but are part of a larger cultural problem.

Despite the progress that has been made, Davies is still wary of dating and online relationships. She believes that there needs to be more accountability and consequences for men who engage in harmful online behavior.
