Here is the simplified news article:

First Lady Melania Trump has joined her husband President Donald Trump as he signed a bill into law that makes posting so-called "revenge porn" and deepfake explicit content illegal. The Take It Down Act criminalises posting "intimate images" - real or AI-generated - online without an individual's consent and requires technology companies to remove the content within 48 hours.

The first lady has championed the bill, arguing children need to be protected from "mean-spirited and hurtful online behaviour". The bill is the sixth piece of legislation Trump has signed in his second term.

"Anyone who intentionally distributes explicit images without the subject's consent will face up to three years in prison," Trump said. The first lady described the new law as a "national victory that will help parents and families protect children from online exploitation".

The bill has received strong bipartisan support, but some digital rights groups say it's too broad and could lead to censorship. Tech companies including Meta, TikTok and Google supported the legislation.
