A man who shared intimate pictures of a woman online has been jailed for 27 months. Mark Harrison from Stoke-on-Trent admitted stalking involving serious distress, and disclosing private sexual photographs with intent to cause distress.

The 41-year-old posted the images on social media using fake accounts, leaving his victim feeling "very alone and embarrassed." The images had been taken almost 20 years ago, and his victim was made aware by other people that they had been put online.

Harrison was arrested in August 2022, where the images were found on his devices, as were internet searches for the woman's name. His victim said that for a long time she felt "very alone and embarrassed" about what was happening to her, despite having done nothing wrong.

Det Con Lauren Constable from Cheshire Police praised the woman's bravery for reporting what happened and said: "Harrisonâ€™s behaviour and actions have had a significant impact on his victim. She has suffered in every aspect of her life and has been subjected to an immeasurable amount of distress because of him."
