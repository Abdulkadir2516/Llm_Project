Jonathan Haidt, author of "The Anxious Generation", argues that smartphones and social media are responsible for the decline in young people's mental health since 2010. He suggests four norms to reverse this trend: no smartphones before the age of 14, no social media until 16, phone-free schools, and more unsupervised play and childhood independence. Haidt believes that parents and society need to take action to protect children from the negative effects of technology. He also acknowledges that his own children have been affected by social media and that he would do things differently if he had the chance. Haidt's book has sold 1.7 million copies and has changed the global conversation around children and digital devices.
