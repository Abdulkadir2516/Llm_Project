Here is the simplified news article:

Children under the age of two should not be exposed to any screens whatsoever and teenagers should have no more than three hours of screen time a day, according to guidelines announced by health authorities in Sweden.

The guidelines, announced on Monday, mark the first time that Folkhälsomyndigheten, Sweden’s public health authority, has stipulated how parents should regulate screen time.

Screen use among two- to five-year-olds should be limited to a maximum of one hour, while children aged between six and 12 should not use screens for more than two hours. Among 13- to 18-year-olds, the limit is three hours.

The health agency also recommended that children do not use screens before bedtime and that screens should not be allowed in bedrooms at night.

The minister of social affairs, Jakob Forssmed, said that children’s health is paying the price for tech companies’ profits and that the guidelines provide important support for children and young people, parents and other caregivers, for a more healthy, conscious and responsible use of screens and digital media.
