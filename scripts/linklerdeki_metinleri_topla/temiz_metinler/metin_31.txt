Georgia Harrison has become a campaigner on tackling violence against women and girls since her ex-partner was jailed for posting a video of her online. 

After he was jailed, Ms Harrison said she had waived her right to anonymity to show other victims she stood in "solidarity" with them. 

Now she has partnered with Thames Valley Police (TVP) for a campaign designed to "start conversations" about consent. 

"Something was done without my consent and itâ€™s something that I have to deal with," she said. 

"I got past it... but because of it I have so many young people always flooding my inboxes with their own stories of sexual assault or sexual abuse, or times when things have been done without their consent." 

TVP launched Consent Conversations after research commissioned by the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) showed a lack of understanding of what constituted rape and sexual offences - especially for those aged between 18 and 24. 

"Statistics show that, for instance, 46% of people recognise that if someone had been drinking or taking drugs, they are still responsible for rape," said Ms Harrison. 

"It's so important that we change young people's perceptions of that, and the only way to do that is to have a conversation." 

She said there was also misunderstanding about consent for people who were in a relationship. 

"They thought that just because you're in a relationship, you can have sex whenever and you don't need consent for it," she said. 

"That really surprised me." 

There were also misconceptions about the withdrawal of consent, with just 28% of young people thinking a person did not have to have sex with someone when they met if they had said they previously said they wanted to.
