Prosecutors told to do more to strip ‘revenge porn’ abusers of victim images

The Crown Prosecution Service is to update its guidance on so-called “revenge porn” crimes to stop perpetrators being allowed to keep explicit photos of their victims. 

An analysis of court records found that, of 98 cases, just three resulted in a deprivation order requiring the offender to give up their devices and delete private photos and videos.

In one case, a man was rebuked by magistrates for “deeply disturbing” behaviour “designed to emotionally blackmail” his victim. He was given a suspended sentence but no deprivation order, leaving the police with no legal power to retain and wipe his devices.

The new guidance will urge prosecutors to make better use of deprivation orders to ensure they are routinely asking courts to impose them. Prosecutors will be told to consider use of the orders from early on in their case strategy.

Campaigners welcomed the changes, saying they were a “step in the right direction”. However, they also called for better investigation processes and a “more comprehensive piece of work” to look at other issues preventing justice for victims.
