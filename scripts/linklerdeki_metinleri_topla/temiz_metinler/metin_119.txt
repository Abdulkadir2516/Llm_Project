Young men and boys fuelled by "strongly misogynistic" online material are hunting for vulnerable women and girls to exploit on websites such as eating disorder and suicide forums, senior officers have said.

The threat from young males wanting to carry out serious harm is so serious that counter-terrorism officers are joining the National Crime Agency (NCA) in the hunt for them, fearing they could go on to attack or kill.

Britain's head of counter-terrorism, Matt Jukes, told the Guardian that a joint taskforce would be set up between his force and the NCA to tackle those fixated with violence online, in what he called a "decisive moment".

The new taskforce will also tackle so-called "com networks" (online communities), which counter-terrorism policing (CTP) and the NCA said involved hundreds of boys and young men. They will also hunt for those viewing material inciting sexual abuse.

James Babbage, the director general of threats for the NCA, said com networks were believed to have hundreds of people in the UK alone. "We think they're mostly doing it for kudos, for notoriety … within their peer group online," he said. "In general, they are looking for victims who are already vulnerable. So they are looking at sort of suicidal ideation sites. They're looking at eating disorders forums."

Jukes said: "Young people who might have felt very isolated in some of their ideas and interests might never even have thought of some of the things which they're now accessing … so people are getting both content and validation. We're going to go after the com networks. We are going to go after those who appear to be administrating and facilitating them."

The material driving the young males to view horrific material and to potentially offend "has a very significant dose of misogyny in it", Babbage added.
