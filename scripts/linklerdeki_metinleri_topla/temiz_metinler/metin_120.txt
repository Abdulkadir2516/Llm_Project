Ofcom has announced its first investigation under the new digital safety laws, looking into an online suicide forum. The regulator is investigating whether the site breached the Online Safety Act by failing to put in place adequate measures to shield its users from illegal content.

The law requires tech platforms to tackle illegal material, such as encouraging suicide, or face fines of up to Â£18m or 10% of global revenue. In extreme cases, Ofcom also has the power to block access to a site or app in the UK.

The forum, which is easily accessible to anyone on the open web, has been connected to at least 50 deaths in the UK and has tens of thousands of members with discussions including methods of suicide.

The Molly Rose Foundation, an internet safety charity, has called on Ofcom to act "quickly and decisively" and shut down the site. The charity was established by the family of Molly Russell, a British teenager who took her own life after viewing online content related to suicide, depression and self-harm.
