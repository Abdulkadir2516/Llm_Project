Parents do not use parental controls on Facebook and Instagram, according to Meta's Nick Clegg. Meta's global affairs chief said there was a "behavioural issue" around using the tools, after admitting they were being ignored by parents.

Speaking at an event hosted by Chatham House in London, Clegg said parents were not using controls that allowed them to set time limits and schedule viewing breaks. He said evidence suggested Meta's apps provided a positive experience for the "overwhelming majority of young people".

Clegg also addressed the controversy over Elon Musk's X platform, which he said had been turned, under the Tesla CEO's ownership, into a "one-man sort of hyper-partisan, ideological hobby-horse".
