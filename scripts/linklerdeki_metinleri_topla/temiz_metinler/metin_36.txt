Here is the simplified news article:

Georgia Harrison, a reality star, compared the leaking of a revenge porn video of herself with Stephen Bear to a "house fire" because of the speed at which it spread. Bear, 34, was jailed in March 2023 for sharing the video of him having sex with Ms Harrison on OnlyFans without her consent.

Ms Harrison told MPs on the Women and Equalities Committee that the video "went viral to a point I can't explain" as it spread round multiple porn sites and was circulated on WhatsApp. She added that it "absolutely horrified" her that an individual had done this to her, but what most horrified her was that these platforms were hosting these videos that were unconsented.

Bear was found guilty of voyeurism and of two counts of disclosing private sexual photographs and films with intent to cause distress. He has been ordered to pay back the Â£22,305 he made from sharing the video.

Ms Harrison said that videos should be taken down the same day if someone in them said they did not give consent for it to be posted online. She also said that her revenge porn ordeal had given her "a lot of fear" at the prospect of starting a family, and that it had changed a lot for her.
