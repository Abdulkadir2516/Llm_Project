NHS staff have voiced concern about the growing numbers of patients who are filming themselves undergoing medical treatment and uploading it to TikTok and Instagram.

Radiographers, who take X-rays and scans, fear the trend could compromise the privacy of other patients being treated nearby and lead to staff having their work discussed online.

The Society of Radiographers (SoR) has gone public with its unease after a spate of incidents in which patients, or someone with them in the hospital, began filming their care.

On one occasion a radiology department assistant from the south coast was inserting a cannula into a patient who had cancer when their 19-year-old daughter began filming.

Ashley d’Aquino, a therapeutic radiographer in London, said a colleague had agreed to take photographs for a patient, “but when the patient handed over her phone the member of staff saw that the patient had also been covertly recording her, to publish on her cancer blog.

Dean Rogers, the SoR’s director of industrial strategy and member relations, urged all NHS trusts and boards to ensure that patients know they need permission from staff before filming.

Dr Katharine Halliday, the president of the Royal College of Radiologists, said: “In my experience, rules about filming and recording are there to protect the privacy and dignity of patients and staff and should be followed accordingly.

Prof Meghana Pandit, NHS England’s co-national medical director (secondary care), said: “We want to do everything possible to support patients’ understanding of their diagnosis and treatment – but it’s vital that, if patients wish to record any part of their NHS care, they discuss this with their healthcare professional first and it remains for personal use only.
