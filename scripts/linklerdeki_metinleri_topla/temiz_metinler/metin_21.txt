Here is the simplified news text:

World Athletics has offered 25 athletes year-round protection on some of their social media platforms, using artificial intelligence, after they were identified as highly targeted individuals for abuse during major events.

The governing body has run a study over the past four years, comprising of two Olympic Games and two World Championships, to analyse online abuse to its athletes. More than 1.4 million posts or comments were analysed, covering 2,438 track, field and road athletes.

The study included comments and targeted abuse - where the athletes were tagged - but excluded direct messaging or non-targeted abuse. World Athletics has not identified the 25 athletes and said the support would be expanded next year.

The study found that 1,258 posts and comments were reported through to the relevant platform, 254 accounts verified to have sent abusive or threatening content have been escalated to the relevant platforms, and two serious cases have been highlighted to authorities.

The study also found that the use of emojis in online abuse has increased significantly, and that fewer athletes post during competition, making the account appear static. World Athletics have created educational materials to distribute to athletes to provide more information on how to better protect themselves and their accounts online.
