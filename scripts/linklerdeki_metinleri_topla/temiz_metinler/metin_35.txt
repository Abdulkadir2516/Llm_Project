Stephen Bear, a former TV personality and convicted sex offender, has settled the sum he was ordered to pay under the Proceeds of Crime Act. In December 2022, Bear was found guilty of voyeurism and two counts of disclosing a private sexual film. He was given a confiscation order of £22,305 in March 2024 and had three months to pay.

Chelmsford Crown Court has confirmed the amount was paid in full on 8 May. Bear, 34, was reported to Essex Police by his ex-girlfriend and Love Island star Georgia Harrison, after he shared a CCTV video of the pair having sex in his garden without her consent.

Half the payment will go to the Home Office, with the remainder of the sum split between the Crown Prosecution Service and Essex Police. The amount does not include a £5,000 victim payment to Ms Harrison, which must be paid on top of the confiscation order taking the total to more than £27,000.

Debbie Price, the deputy chief crown prosecutor for the Crown Prosecution Service, said: "It’s important criminals understand that aside from the sentence they receive, we will also go after their bank accounts and assets to prevent them from enjoying the money they made from their crimes.”
