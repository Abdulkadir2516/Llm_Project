Here is the simplified news text:

More Australians now access their news via social media than traditional news outlets. According to the 2025 Digital News Report, television remains the most popular source of news (37%), but more consumers now go to Facebook, YouTube, and other platforms than to a legacy news outlet.

The number of people reporting they use online news as their main source of news has dropped dramatically – from 28% in 2024 to 23% in 2025 – while social media as a main source of news has risen one percentage point from 25% to 26%.

More than one in 20 respondents (6%) said they had asked artificial intelligence chatbots for news in the week prior. The report also found that young Australians are increasingly drawn to video news on TikTok and Instagram.

The University of Canberra survey shows social media is a popular place for people aged 18 to 24 to watch news videos, with more than one-third watching them on TikTok (37%) and Instagram (34%).

Trust in news has risen slightly this year and is highest among people who have undertaken news literacy education. ABC News (60%) is the most trusted news outlet, followed by SBS News (59%), local newspapers (58%), BBC News (57%), and Channel Seven News (55%).
