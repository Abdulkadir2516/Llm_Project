The Wikimedia Foundation is challenging the UK's online safety legislation in the high court, saying some of its regulations would expose Wikipedia to "manipulation and vandalism". The foundation claims that if it is subjected to the act's toughest category 1 duties, the safety and privacy of Wikipedia's volunteer editors would be undermined, its entries could be manipulated and vandalised, and resources would be diverted from protecting and improving the site.

The foundation is seeking a judicial review of the categorisation regulations, which it says are too broad and vague. It argues that the rules would require Wikipedia to verify the identities of its volunteer editors, which would breach its commitment to collecting minimal data about readers and contributors.

Punishments for breaching the act include fines of either Â£18m or 10% of a company's global turnover and, in extreme cases, access to a service being blocked in the UK. The foundation says that volunteer communities working in more than 300 languages could be exposed to "data breaches, stalking, vexatious lawsuits or even imprisonment by authoritarian regimes".
