Here is the simplified news text:

Guides from across the county learned about modern policing and earned their police challenge badges at an interaction day organised by Wiltshire Police. The event aimed to build critical thinking and leadership skills, while also allowing the police force to hear the concerns of young people.

Among the activities were teamwork and problem-solving exercises, including the opportunity to "solve" a crime. The guides were given "beer goggles" to wear, which simulated the experience of drunkenness.

To earn their badge, the Guides had to complete a series of activities including learning about police clothing and equipment and designing their own police force.

Chief Constable of Wiltshire Police, Catherine Roper, expressed her enthusiasm for the outreach event. She said it was insightful event for the police, adding that the girls were worried about being out and about late at night, and wanted more visibility and events like this.

On completing all three events, the guides were presented with their badges at a ceremony lead by Chief Constable Roper. The force say they will run a similar event for local Scout groups in the autumn.
