Football players being supported amid online abuse

Cheltenham Town's Michael Flynn deleted social media after receiving "horrible stuff" from trolls, and hearing worries for younger players especially. The club has employed safeguarding experts to work with players in the squad amid increasing online abuse.

Flynn said he was "very fortunate" for social media not to exist during his upbringing, and feels "sorry" for the young people of today. He said the club offers "an avenue" to anyone seeking support after receiving online abuse.

Daisy Greenwell, co-founder of Smartphone Free Childhood, said the internet's lack of regulation meant it was "a wild west" for children. She added that some parents have discovered their child is part of a 5,000 member Whatsapp group, which can quickly degenerate into horrible, toxic, bullying, and racism.
