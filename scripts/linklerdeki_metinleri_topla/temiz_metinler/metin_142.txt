Social media has overtaken television as a source of news in the US for the first time, according to a comprehensive analysis of media consumption. 54% of Americans said they received news from social media, while half said they sourced news from TV networks.

The study by the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism surveyed almost 100,000 news consumers worldwide and revealed a further diminishing of the influence of traditional news organisations. More people are heading to podcasters, YouTubers, and TikTokers.

The role of news influencers, who use their personal brand to win an online following, is growing. Podcaster Joe Rogan was found to be hugely influential, especially in reaching young men.

The findings confirm the huge changes taking place in news consumption worldwide. Online video may be a good way to engage younger audiences, but there is very little commercial upside for publishers, with most news consumption taking place via platforms rather than owned and operated news websites.

A decade ago, just two online networks were delivering news content to more than 10% of the global sample. That has now grown to six. Facebook reaches more than a third (36%), while YouTube is not far behind (30%).

There are concerns that truth will suffer. Overall, 58% of the populations studied remain worried about their ability to tell what is true from what is false online. Concern is highest in Africa (73%) and the US (73%).

The phenomenon of news avoidance continues to rise as users restrict the amount they consume, complaining about feeling overwhelmed by a gloomy news agenda. Four in 10 people in the study's global sample said they sometimes or often avoid the news â€“ up from 29% in 2017.

The UK has one of the highest proportions of news avoiders, where 46% say they sometimes or often avoid the news.
