Here is the simplified news article:

US officials have challenged Britain's communications regulator, Ofcom, over the impact of new online safety laws on freedom of expression. A group of officials from the US State Department's Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor met with Ofcom in London and raised concerns that the new act could infringe on free speech.

Ofcom officials said the new rules were only in place to deal with explicitly illegal content and material harmful to children. The State Department said the meeting was part of its initiative to defend freedom of expression in Europe and around the world.

The meeting follows months of pressure from figures close to President Trump over free speech. The US Vice-President, JD Vance, has complained of "infringements on free speech" in the UK. Elon Musk, a close ally of Trump, has claimed that some prison sentences handed down to people who incited riots on social media were a breach of free speech.

The online safety act applies to all sites and apps that publish user-made content, as well as large search engines. It lists 130 "priority offences", including child sexual abuse, terrorism, and fraud.
