Britain's media regulator, Ofcom, is scrambling to close a legal loophole that allows politicians on GB News and other broadcasters to in effect act as newsreaders. Ofcom has now dropped 11 investigations or rulings relating to incidents in which politicians read out news items – a practice it believed breached impartiality rules. Most of the cases relate to GB News, but others relate to TalkTV and LBC.

The cases have been dropped after GB News successfully challenged two recent Ofcom rulings relating to the former Conservative cabinet minister Jacob Rees-Mogg over reading updates about news stories. The high court ruled that he did not breach the rules because he was presenting a “current affairs” programme, rather than a news programme.

Ofcom is now conducting a rapid review of those regulations to ensure that all programmes are covered by the same impartiality rules. The regulator said: “Ofcom will now review [the relevant rules] and consult on proposed changes to restrict politicians from presenting news in any type of programme. We aim to move as quickly as possible with the publication of this consultation so broadcasters should expect it later in the spring.”

An Ofcom review of a similar incident involving the Reform UK leader, Nigel Farage, on GB News has now been cancelled, alongside five investigations into shows featuring the former Conservative minister Jake Berry, ex-MEP Alex Phillips and former deputy Reform UK leader David Bull on Talk, as well as Labour’s David Lammy on LBC.

Ofcom had already withdrawn three other decisions against GB News in light of the high court’s findings, including over programmes presented by the Conservative MP Esther McVey and the former Tory MP Philip Davies. Broadcasting rules state that the news must be “presented with due impartiality”, and that politicians cannot act as newsreaders except when “editorially justified”.
