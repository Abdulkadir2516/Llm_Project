Ministers are looking at giving children an “app cap” or curfew to prevent them becoming addicted to social media, the technology secretary has indicated.

Peter Kyle, whose department is responsible for online safety, said he wanted to do more to protect children from excessive use of smartphones, and help them have a healthy relationship with technology.

He is understood to be considering options such as two-hour curfews for social media apps, or blocks on children accessing content after 10pm or during school hours.

Kyle said he knew people felt strongly about protecting children and that new legislation on online safety, being rolled out now, could be strengthened further.

Nearly a quarter of children spend more than four hours a day on an internet-enabled device, a survey for the children’s commissioner suggested earlier this year.

The education secretary, Bridget Phillipson, is also looking at the effects of smartphone bans in some schools in England, a policy idea supported by the National Education Union amid growing concerns about the impact of social media on children.
