Digital tech can offer rich opportunities for child development, study says

Although it has been argued that under-threes should not have any screen time at all, research has found that digital tech can offer “rich opportunities” for young children’s development.

A two-year study, Toddlers, Tech and Talk, funded by the Economic and Social Research Council and led by researchers from Manchester Metropolitan University, looked at children’s interactions with everything from Amazon Alexa to Ring doorbells, in diverse communities across the UK, to find out how tech was influencing 0- to three-year-olds’ early talk and literacy.

The researchers found that children were not only interacting with smart devices and appliances when very young, but also that digital tech could have benefits for language development and other skills.

“The evidence generated through this study suggests that young children’s digital activity often involves sensory exploration through touch, vision, hearing, movement and embodied cognition,” the report said.

The report described how video calls created “rich opportunities” in multilingual households for children to learn words and phrases from across languages, and about the cultures of relatives overseas.

The study, which surveyed 1,400 parents in the UK, including 40 case studies in family homes, with 20 education professionals interviewed, also looked at families’ TV habits, and found “several parents mentioned that their child had learned specific words and phrases when watching certain programmes intently”.

Researchers hope their findings will be used to inform policy and good practice, with parents agreeing there was a need for greater protection of children’s privacy and security.
