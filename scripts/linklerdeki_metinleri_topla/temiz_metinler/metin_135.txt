A religious TV channel has been fined £150,000 for giving UK airtime to an evangelist selling “miracle spring water” that was claimed to cure illnesses such as lung cancer and diabetes and produce huge financial windfalls.

Britain’s communications regulator, Ofcom, penalised the operator of The Word Network, a religious channel aimed at the Christian community available via pay TV, after an investigation into the programme Peter Popoff Ministries.

During two episodes of the show, fronted by the US TV evangelist Popoff and his wife, viewers were repeatedly asked to order the ministry’s miracle spring water. Popoff made claims about the product’s supposed miraculous powers and aired testimonies from members of his congregation as he invited viewers to order it.

Those providing the testimonials claimed that pouring the water over their hands brought about recovery from illnesses such as lung cancer, diabetes and intestinal disease, as well as curing drug addiction. Others said they subsequently came into large sums of money, started a new business opportunity, received a new home or were “delivered” from student loan debt.

Ofcom said that it “considered that these claims related to viewers’ health and wealth and such claims had the potential to cause harm”.
