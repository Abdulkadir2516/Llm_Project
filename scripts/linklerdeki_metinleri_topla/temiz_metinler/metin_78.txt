Year 9 students in South Australia are to debate whether the tradwife movement is good for women as part of a Debating SA competition. The topic has sparked fierce discussion before the debates have even started.

Some people have questioned on social media whether the topic is appropriate, with some concerned that female students arguing in the affirmative would be making the case for their own subjugation.

The tradwife movement has become associated with anti-feminist sentiment, amplified by misogynist figures including Andrew Tate and those in the manosphere.

Debating SA said it was shocked and surprised by the reaction. It took the unusual step of sending a clarification to schools saying the definition it was using was synonymous with a stay-at-home parent.

The organisation said it had received abusive phone calls, with people accusing it of undoing centuries of female advancement.

A Queensland-based teen educator and author, Rebecca Sparrow, shared an email on Facebook from a reader "horrified" by the debating topic.

South Australia's education minister, Blair Boyer, said he had to ask his staff what the tradwife movement was, and understood it came with some controversy.

A researcher into the far right, Kristy Campion, said tradwife culture drew on "cottage core" dreams of a simpler life, but also linked it to "white womanhood", anti-feminism, anti-LGBTQ+ and anti-immigrant sentiments.
