Georgia Harrison has said she continues to "really struggle" with how a sexually explicit video of her remains readily available online. The reality TV personality has been outspoken about her former partner Stephen Bear being convicted of sharing a private film of them having sex.

She waived her right to anonymity and Bear, 35, of Loughton in Essex, was jailed for 21 months in 2023. The 30-year-old is fronting a two-part series with ITV, where she looks into the issue of deepfakes and image-based sexual abuse.

Asked about the biggest challenge in making the documentary, she said: "I would say obviously the hardest part for me was having to see how widespread my video still is. I have a lot of people messaging me all the time, sending me clips of it. It's always something in the back of my mind, but having to really face head on exactly where it is and how many places it's in was a real struggle for me."

In 2023, the previous Conservative government passed the Online Safety Act, requiring social media companies to protect users from harmful content. But last month, the Labour government's technology secretary Peter Kyle described UK laws on internet safety as "very uneven" and "unsatisfactory".

Harrison, who has appeared on The Only Way is Essex and Love Island, also said she was regularly contacted by mothers whose children have been affected by fake videos created with artificial intelligence. "It is the same feeling of humiliation, a violation of literally being de-clothed without your consent," she said.

Harrison hopes "raising awareness" of these issues can "hopefully" mean "change within the internet, so in the future not just me but any person who has been a victim of revenge porn won't have to wake up every day wondering if it's still out there".
