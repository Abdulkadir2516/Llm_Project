A woman has spent a year without using some social media apps after realising they had "completely consumed" her life. Marina Jennings, 20, from Jersey, said the impact of using social media since she was 12 years old had been scarring and would stay with her forever.

She said she decided to permanently delete the TikTok app from her phone, with a temporary "detox" ban on Instagram, because the platforms gave her "great anxiety". After stepping away from TikTok, Ms Jennings said she felt lucky to have "found the root of the problem".

Ms Jennings said she was "worried about what she looked like constantly" and the apps caused "great anxiety" and affected her ability to concentrate on day-to-day tasks. She said she became "very insecure" after regularly seeing unrealistic photographs of other women.

A survey found that 51% of year 12 girls had received a sexual video or photo, compared to 40% of boys in the same year group. It also found that 37% of young people in years 6, 8, 10 and 12 had sent messages to a stranger through online chat rooms, and that a higher proportion of girls (36%) than boys (15%) felt pressured to look or appear a certain way on social media.

A parent, Vicky O'Neil, said that smartphones had made parenting "much more difficult". She said that the government needed to make changes to the legislation to address the issue. A youth worker, Liam Doherty, said that children should spend more time outdoors and that families needed to do more to address the problem.

Jersey's Education Minister Deputy Rob Ward said that mobile phones were not permitted in any of the island's classrooms and that government policies were being reviewed. He said that there was a need for "a bespoke policy for Jersey in terms of social media".
