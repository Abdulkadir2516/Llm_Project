Overwhelmed by stress and social media, young people are finding new language to describe the inevitable irritation and anger that ensue. The term "crash out" has been recognized by the journal American Speech and was runner-up for the publication's 2024 word of the year.

To the TikTok generation, to crash out is to become suddenly, uncontrollably angry or distressed. This sense of crashing out originated as a slang term in African American Vernacular English and may be more than a decade old. But it's become better known recently thanks to TikTok.

The widespread nature of this phenomenon among gen Z has in turn popularized the expression. "I like that there's a term for it now," one 24-year-old social media user told the New York Times.

It's also true that similar outbursts were once covered by the term "meltdown" – the emotional equivalent of a collapsing nuclear reactor core – but crashing out is more nuanced. Perhaps you're from the era when such behavior was known as "acting out", suggesting a performative element to the outburst.

However you label it, it's all just "losing it", isn't it? I'm going to do some breathing exercises now. Is that a preventive measure to avoid crashing out? One of them. Others include self-soothing – calming some or all of your senses – and taking a break from social media.

So one of the cures for a condition popularized by TikTok is … getting off TikTok? Inevitably, yes. Do say: "Regulating stress levels is central to maintaining an emotional balance." Don't say: "Don't worry, you're just having what is technically known as a tantrum."
