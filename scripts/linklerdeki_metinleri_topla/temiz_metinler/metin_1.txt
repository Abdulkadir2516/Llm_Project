Georgia Harrison has been awarded an MBE for her efforts to tackle violence against women and girls. She will be awarded for her work on the Online Safety Act in 2023. Harrison says she feels "a responsibility to help" the many women who are victims of crimes such as intimate image abuse and deepfaking.

Her ex-partner Stephen Bear was jailed for 21 months in 2023 after uploading sexual footage of himself and Harrison to OnlyFans filmed without her consent. Harrison has visited 10 Downing Street to discuss her views on image-based abuse legislation.

Harrison, who is being awarded her MBE as part of the King's Birthday Honours, said she had to re-read the letter she received from King Charles "three times" as she "just couldn't believe it". "It's definitely not something I anticipated and it feels nice to have my work recognised because with campaigning sometimes you feel like a lot goes unnoticed," she said.

Harrison has been working with the government on the Online Safety Act and as part of the Women and Equalities Committee. She says she has been working on improving timescales for women who want to report crimes against them - as currently they only have six months after a crime has taken place to tell the police about it.

Harrison says she has also been receiving more and more messages from victims of deepfakes, which are videos, pictures or audio clips made with AI to look or sound real. She hopes that these type of lessons will have an impact for the next generation.
