Royal Mail has asked Ofcom to allow it to offer tracking for all parcels sent first or second class around the UK, as the company raised concerns over the communications regulator’s planned shake-up of the postal service.

In its response to the consultation, Royal Mail called on Ofcom to remove “unnecessary regulation” that prevents it from offering parcel tracking to customers using its standard services.

The company said the ability to track parcels was a basic requirement in the competitive delivery market: “The current restriction does not reflect what customers want and renders the universal service unfit for the digital age,” it said.

Royal Mail also outlined concerns that some of the proposed changes to the USO, including reliability targets, would “add significant cost”, potentially resulting in higher prices for consumers.

Ofcom’s proposals for Royal Mail include setting reliability targets requiring 99.5% of first-class letters to be delivered within three days, and 99.5% of second-class letters within five days.

Royal Mail has struggled to make deliveries on time in recent years, and the regulator said it had been fined more than £16m for missed delivery targets over the previous 18 months.

The regulator is also planning to allow second-class letters to be delivered on alternate weekdays and to stop Saturday deliveries, while maintaining first-class letter deliveries six days a week, which it said would still meet the public’s needs.

Martin Seidenberg, the chief executive of IDS, said: “It is vital that universal service reform delivers a postal service which is reliable, affordable and better meets what customers need for both letters and parcels.”
