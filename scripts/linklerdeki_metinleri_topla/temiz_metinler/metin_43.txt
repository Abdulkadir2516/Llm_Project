Here is the simplified news article:

It will be easier to prosecute people for sharing so-called revenge porn after a change in the law in England and Wales. Amendments to the Online Safety Bill will remove the requirement for prosecutors to prove perpetrators intended to cause distress to secure a conviction. Sharing deepfake porn is also being criminalised for the first time. Both offences will be punishable by up to six months in prison. This would rise to two years if intent to cause distress, alarm or humiliation, or to obtain sexual gratification could be proved.

TV personality Georgia Harrison, whose ex-partner was jailed earlier this year for posting intimate footage of her on his OnlyFans account, welcomed the change to the legislation. Justice Secretary Alex Chalk said the changes would give police and prosecutors the powers they need to bring perpetrators to justice, safeguarding women and girls from such vile abuse.

Deepfakes have been increasing in recent years, with a website that virtually strips women naked receiving 38 million hits in the first eight months of 2021. Research shows one in seven women and one in nine men aged between 18 and 34 have experienced threats to share intimate images. More than 28,000 reports of disclosing private sexual images without consent were recorded by police between April 2015 and December 2021.

Domestic Abuse Commissioner Nicole Jacobs welcomed the news, saying the changes would "hold perpetrators to account for this insidious form of abuse". Ruth Davison, chief executive of the domestic abuse charity Refuge, pointed to the "woefully low" conviction rates for intimate image abuse.
