Here is the simplified news article:

Everton have strongly condemned the "threatening, racist, and misogynistic abuse" aimed at Dominic Calvert-Lewin's wife on social media and are working with Merseyside police to identify the culprits.

The Everton striker's wife, Sandra, was targeted after posting her support for Calvert-Lewin after the farewell to Goodison Park on Sunday and suggesting his efforts are underappreciated.

In a statement the club said it "strongly condemns the threatening, racist, and misogynistic abuse directed towards the wife of Dominic Calvert-Lewin on social media", adding: "This sinister and intimidating behaviour is not only deeply hurtful and distressing, it is also criminal â€“ and does not represent the values of Everton or the overwhelming majority of our supporters.

The club has a zero-tolerance policy towards all forms of discriminatory and abusive behaviour. We are working closely with Merseyside police and the Premier League to ensure the individuals responsible are identified and held accountable for their actions. We will continue to offer our full support to Dominic and his family."
