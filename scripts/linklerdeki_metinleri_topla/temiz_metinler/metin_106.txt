Here is the simplified news article:

The cost of a mobile data package is holding back many female entrepreneurs in developing countries, according to recent research. While social media marketing is crucial for female business owners who have access to it, 45% of women in business in low- and middle-income countries said they did not have regular internet access because of the expense and connection issues.

Nearly 3,000 female entrepreneurs from 96 developing countries contributed to a report by the Cherie Blair Foundation for Women into the challenges women face in the digital economy. The women surveyed ran businesses including food or fashion outlets and farms, using their phones to engage directly with customers, receive digital payments and promote their work.

Internet connectivity is fundamental to digital inclusion and business success, but persistent challenges still prevent women from fully participating. Privacy concerns, security risks and online harassment remain major barriers. While 92% of those surveyed owned a smartphone, access to the internet was often restricted. Only about a quarter of the women used e-commerce platforms such as Amazon or Alibaba.

Safety was also a concern for women selling online: 57% said they faced harassment while selling online, 36% did not use their names and 41% did not post photos on their business profiles to maintain their privacy. Many said they feared aggressive negotiating by men, potential violence, unwanted advances and being sent unsolicited explicit pictures.

Closing the digital gender gap could earn developing countries $1.3tn in GDP by the end of the decade. The report said developing countries should be investing in mobile data networks to improve connectivity and reduce cost, and technology companies should develop robust measures to protect women from harassment.
