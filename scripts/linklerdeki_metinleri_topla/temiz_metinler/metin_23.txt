Safer Internet Day is on Tuesday, 11 February 2025, and the theme is "Too good to be true? Protecting yourself and others from scams online". The UK Safer Internet Centre coordinates the event, which has grown to become the UK's biggest celebration of online safety.

According to the Office for National Statistics, in the year ending March 2023, 35% of children aged 10-15 accepted a friend request online from someone they did not know, 8.5% shared their location publicly, and an estimated 19.2% exchanged messages online with someone they had never met in person.

Scams are a major danger facing young people online. Common internet scams targeting teenagers include social media "spoofing", online shopping and counterfeiting, preying on teenagers' insecurities to sell fraudulent health and beauty products and/or services, creating fake contests and competitions, and using webcams to blackmail.

Warning signs of a typical scam include an offer that is "too good to be true", use of urgency to pressurize, use of extreme emotion to pressurize, and asking for money or personal information. Young people can protect themselves by being vigilant, using strong and separate passwords, using two-step verification, and talking to a trusted adult if they are unsure.

Three videos feature Jasmine, Phoenix, and Aimee, who share their experiences of online hate, bullying, and scams. They offer advice on how to deal with online abuse, including speaking to a support network, taking a break from gaming, and being vigilant.
