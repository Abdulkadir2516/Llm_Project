The Deputy First Minister Emma Little-Pengelly has said it is "incredibly important" that abuse against politicians is tackled after a man was prosecuted for threatening to kill her.

Aaron Thomas Curragh, 34, of Whincroft Road in Belfast, last week pleaded guilty to a charge brought against him through the 2023 Online Safety Act. Curragh had previously been convicted of attacking the office of Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) assembly member Joanne Bunting.

Last week a court hearing heard Curragh had sent a message to Little-Pengelly via the social media platform X "which conveyed a threat of death or harm".

Speaking in the assembly on Monday, Little-Pengelly said she was pleased that there had been a prosecution and that Curragh would be sentenced shortly. "It is incredibly important the courts take these matters seriously, it requires all of us to stand shoulder to shoulder to say it's wrong," she added.
