Katie Boulter has revealed the extent to which she has been targeted by online abusers who have sent death threats, explicit pictures and toxic comments during her matches. The British No 2 believes much of the abuse comes from gamblers who have lost money.

One message sent to the 28-year-old during the French Open, said: “Hope you get cancer”. Another told her: “Go to hell. I lost money my mother sent me.” While a third instructed her to buy “candles and a coffin for your entire family” and threatened to damage her “grandmother’s grave if she’s not dead by tomorrow”.

After her victory in Nottingham, Boulter said she realised people simply did not know the extent to which tennis players were being abused. “I looked on my phone this morning and there were hundreds of messages of people reacting to it [the interview],” she said.

“A lot of comments are very emotional responses. I wouldn’t say they are normal responses. They always seem to be during a match and a lot of them do reference gambling, saying you lost them a lot of money. We’re still all learning, but a lot of it’s from that.

Tennis authorities have been using an AI-led detection system called Threat Matrix since last year to try to prevent the worst of the abuse reaching the players. The WTA’s and ITF’s first report on the subject, which was published on Tuesday, outlined the scale of the problem, revealing 458 players were shown to have been subjected to direct abuse or threat.

Boulter’s fiance, Alex de Minaur, praised her for highlighting the issue. The WTA players’ council member Jessica Pegula called for the gambling industry and social media companies to take action. “Online abuse is unacceptable and something that no player should have to endure,” she said.
