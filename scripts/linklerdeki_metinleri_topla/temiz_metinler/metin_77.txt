Here is the main text of the news article:

Donald Trump is the archetypal edgelord: endlessly provocative, chronically online, allergic to truth and addicted to the attention his outrage generates. He didn’t just dabble in edgelordery for clicks – he built his own social media megaphone to broadcast it. It’s as if Truth Social had been handed the nuclear codes.

Chiles writes about edgelords with bemused detachment. But Trump shows what happens when trolling becomes statecraft, and moral vacuity masquerades as “telling it like it is”. This isn’t just an online persona – it’s a governing style with global consequences.

Next time Adrian spots an edgelord, he might glance across the Atlantic and realise that we’re all still living with the results.
