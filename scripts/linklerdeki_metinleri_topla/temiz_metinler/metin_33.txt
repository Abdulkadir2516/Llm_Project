A woman who posted naked photos of her father's mistress on an escort site has been told she will "almost inevitably" go to prison after pleading guilty midway through her trial.

Eleanor Brown admitted two counts of sharing private sexual photographs of the victim without consent at Leeds Crown Court on Thursday.

The 24-year-old had previously denied the charges but changed her pleas during the second week of her trial.

Brown, of Peel Street in Morley, was released on bail ahead of sentencing on 21 October.

The court had previously heard how Brown had set up a fake profile for the woman on an escort website in 2022 and posted photos of her online as an act of "revenge" after her father had had an affair with her some years previously.

The profile was accompanied by the phone number of the victim's husband which, as a result, was repeatedly called by strangers, jurors were told.

Brown also posted "derogatory comments" about the woman on her husband's business' website and messaged the woman's daughter, saying: "I will make sure your mum is never allowed to forget what she did to my family."

Giving evidence to the court, the victim, who cannot be named for legal reasons, said she experienced "a deep, sickening feeling of just complete panic" when she found out intimate photos of her had been posted online.

Her husband said he had also received abusive messages from the defendant after contacting her parents to ask her to stop.

Judge Alexander Menary said her admission of guilt had come at the "eleventh hour and 59th minute".

Adjourning the hearing ahead of sentencing, he said it was "almost inevitable" she would go to prison "because of the nature of the offending and the persistence of it".
