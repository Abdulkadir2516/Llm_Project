Here is the simplified news text:

A Texas jury has awarded a woman $1.2bn after ruling that she was the victim of revenge porn. The woman, who was named only by the initials DL in court documents, filed a harassment lawsuit against her former boyfriend in 2022. The suit alleged that he posted intimate pictures of her online to "publicly shame" her after a break-up.

The woman had shared intimate photos of herself with the defendant during the relationship. After a break-up in 2021, he is accused of having posted the photos on social media platforms and adult websites without her consent. He allegedly sent links of the photos to her friends and family through a publicly accessible Dropbox folder.

He was also accused of having access to her phone, social media accounts and email, as well as to the camera system at her mother's home, which he used to spy on her. At one point, the defendant allegedly sent the woman a message: "You will spend the rest of your life trying and failing to wipe yourself off the internet. Everyone you ever meet will hear the story and go looking. Happy Hunting."

Lawyers for the woman claim her former boyfriend posted the pictures "to inflict a combination of psychological abuse, domestic violence and sexual abuse". He did not show up in court and did have an attorney to represent him. He was ordered to pay the woman $200m for past and future mental anguish, as well as $1bn in exemplary damages.
