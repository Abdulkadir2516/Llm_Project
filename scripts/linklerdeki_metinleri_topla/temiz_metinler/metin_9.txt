First Minister Michelle O'Neill has called online abuse targeting Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) MP Carla Lockhart "disgraceful and unacceptable".

Lockhart claimed that accounts which send her abuse "on a daily basis are followed by some Sinn FÃ©in MLAs". O'Neill said she contacted Lockhart directly to condemn the abuse.

Lockhart said that the abuse she received online is "vile and relentless" and "often not about my politics, in the main it is about my appearance and how I look". She added that online abuse "was never" an issue before entering into politics.

Lockhart also highlighted the need to call people out saying that it was "important" not just for her but for others. Alliance MP Sorcha Eastwood has voiced her support for Lockhart, saying the abuse was "absolutely vile".
