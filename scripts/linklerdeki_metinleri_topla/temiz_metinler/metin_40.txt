Here is the simplified news text:

TV personality Georgia Harrison has said she has had "serious conversations" with Labour MPs about a bid to represent the party in Essex. The former Love Island star, 28, told the Sun she felt Britain needed "more normal people going into politics". Ms Harrison has campaigned on violence against women and girls and hopes a run for Parliament would inspire girls. Her ex-partner Stephen Bear was jailed earlier this year for posting intimate footage of her online.
