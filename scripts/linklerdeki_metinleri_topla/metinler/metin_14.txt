PCC Matthew Scott will be in the hotseat on Thursday on BBC Radio Kent
Women's safety and online bullying will be among the topics being discussed when Kent's police and crime commissioner answers questions on BBC Radio Kent.
PCC Matthew Scott will appear on the hot seat on the Dominic King show on Thursday from 10:00 GMT.
This month,
Kent Police released a video about violence against women and girls
with Kent County Council and the Kent and Medway Violence Reduction unit.
And a survey from Mr Scott's office in February said
about a third of children had been bullied online
.
Listen to the Dominic King show from 10:00 - 14:00, Monday to Friday, on BBC Radio Kent or on
BBC Sounds
.
After the survey was published, Mr Scott said: "It is more important now than ever that we talk about the problems that social media, smartphones and online bullying are causing to young people."
In previous appearances on the show, Mr Scott has said he wants an
increased share of council tax
to go to funding Kent Police.
The PCC will also take questions from members of the public on the air.
