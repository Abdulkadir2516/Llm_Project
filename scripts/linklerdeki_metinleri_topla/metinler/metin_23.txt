JASMINE:I was on a reality TV show that was viewed by millions of people, and it was a great experience. It was really fun. But off the back of that, I received some online hate, and it was the first time I've ever been through anything like that and it made me quite anxious to leave the house because I thought, oh, anyone that saw the show has this negative opinion of me.
It made me believe the things that they were saying about me was a true representation of myself. The reason that people give online hate is because of the anonymity of the internet. They really forget that the person that you're saying these bad things about is a real-life person with real-life feelings. I now have more healthy habits when I use social media, and I now know not to take the comments of what people say about me seriously.
I've reduced my screen time, which just makes social media a bit less consuming. It means that I can focus a bit more on the outside world, and it's just giving me a little bit more perspective. The advice that I would like to give to anyone else that's maybe going through anything similar is to value the opinions of people that know you more, like your friends or your family.
I just really would recommend anyone to use a support network and B, if you're feeling a bit too shy to reach out to your support network, really try and take that leap of faith, because I promise you they're just there to help you.

Phoenix, an avid gamer, recalls the toxic bullying they faced while playing video games online, offering advice on how to deal with negativity.

PHOENIX:
You know, I was 13 when I first started playing video games. I would usually play for, you know, around maybe 10 hours. 12 hours when I was really getting into it. And I got into a game with a really toxic person and since the first minute I was playing, he was just attacking me personally. He was attacking how I play and just making really nasty assumptions about me as a person, you know, saying bad things about my family members as well.
Bullying through games is obviously very easy to do, because you're hiding behind a name and you're hiding behind a screen as well. So you feel like the words you say to other people won't affect them because you're not saying it face to face. It's never nice to receive that kind of hate. The best way to go around people saying bad things to you is just muting them or just taking a break.
You know, 5- 10 minutes is okay. You get to clear your head. Taking walks definitely helps. Just things that you like. Just take your mind away from the game and the people you've come across. You know, as many people have said to me, it's just pixels at the end of the day. If you're losing ranked games or you're losing your place in the league, you know you can always get back up.

Aimee shares a cautionary tale about being scammed on social media while trying to purchase concert tickets, explaining how she has learned to spot red flags and avoid making the same mistake again.

Video Transcript
AIMEE:
This isn't something I normally do, but I don't want anyone to make the same mistakes as me. So here we go. We first found out about the resale tickets for the concert because my sister found someone that was selling the tickets. So she saw the post on social media, and then she phoned me. She's getting really excited saying, we've got these tickets that we've really wanted.
And it looked totally legit. It said: Hi, like looking to sell these tickets. I bought them in a mad panic when we got pre-sale tickets. And then I was like, âamazing!â Was really buzzin'. And then we got a photo and a screenshot of what we thought were the actual tickets and they looked totally legit. So I set up a payment link, sent the money over.
I kept refreshing my email, my account for the tickets. Nothing was coming through. After about 45 minutes I didn't get the tickets. My heart sank and I thought, you know, this isn't right. So I was speaking to my sister and saying, I think we've been scammed. Looking back now, and in hindsight, there were a few red flags.They were weirdly capitalized and some letters that, you know, wouldn't be capitalized, the reluctance to send them or that we had screenshots of what we thought were the tickets. You could sort of see a bit closer that maybe they'd been edited.
I mean, I really thought of myself as being really social media savvy and being really good online. You know, probably wrongly, I thought these sorts of things only happen to older generations. If I could go back in time and give myself advice, I would say just double-check what you're buying. Double-check the posts on social media.
If at any point it doesn't feel right, just hit it on the head and finally, if you don't get the tickets, it's not the end of the world. There'll be other opportunities. You want to get it right.

Context
Safer Internet Day is coordinated in the UK by the
UK Safer Internet Centre
and has grown steadily over recent years to become the UK's biggest celebration of online safety.
In 2025 Safer Internet Day will be on Tuesday, 11 February
and the theme will be
'Too good to be true? Protecting yourself and others from scams online'.
The
Office for National Statistics carries out an annual crime survey
that includes data concerning children aged 10-15 years old. According to it, in the year ending March 2023, 35% accepted a friend request online from someone they did not know, 8.5% shared their location publicly, and an estimated 19.2% exchanged messages online with someone they had never met in person.
Scams are only one of the potential dangers facing young people when navigating the online world. Many people assume that older age groups are most susceptible to online scams, but research suggests that young, 'digital natives', are equally at risk.
Common internet scams targeting teenagers include social media 'spoofing', when scammers create a false identity online â eg pose as a well known brand; online shopping and counterfeiting â taking payment on a fake website and offering nothing in return; preying on teenagers' insecurities to sell fraudulent health and beauty products and/or services; creating fake contests and competitions â eg talent competitions, that lure in teenagers and then demand money; use of webcams â eg when scammers acquire images and use them to blackmail.
Some of the warning signs of a typical scam include: an offer which is 'too good to be true'; use of urgency to pressurise; use of extreme emotion to pressurise; asking for money or personal information.
Steps young people can take to protect themselves from scams include: being vigilant about looking for the signs of a scam; using strong, separate passwords; using '2SV' â two-step verification; talking to a trusted adult if they are unsure.

Possible discussion points before the video
Have any pupils been approached online by someone they do not know?
Have any pupils played a game online with a stranger?
Do they know what 'spoofing' is (disguising any kind of communication to appear to be from a known, trusted source)? What types of online abuse can they identify? And what particular 'scams' are they aware of?
Back to top
Possible discussion points after watching the video
Invite pupils summarise the advice offered for dealing with online abuse. [Jasmine advises speaking to family and friends -your 'support network'; Phoenix recommends taking a break from gaming to clear your mind; Amy recommends being vigilant; all three speak about keeping things in perspective].
Why do pupils think the video was filmed this way as video 'confessions'? What effect does it achieve?
