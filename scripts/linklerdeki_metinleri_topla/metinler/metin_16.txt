The anonymous surveys were completed by more than 3,500 students
Almost a third of youngsters in Kent have been bullied online, a survey from the county's police and crime commissioner has found.
Kent's police and crime commissioner (PCC) Matthew Scott's youth and parent surveys, held at the end of 2024, found almost 34% of primary children and 29% of secondary pupils had been bullied or picked on online.
Almost nine out of 10 young people said they continued to use the online platform they had been bullied on.
Mr Scott said: "It is more important now than ever that we talk about the problems that social media, smartphones and online bullying are causing to young people."
Of those who had been bullied only 46% of secondary students and 57% of primary pupils told their parents or guardians, while 30% of secondary and 21% of primary children said they had not told anyone.
Mr Scott said: "We need to support schools in implementing smartphone policies in schools, but also educate parents about the risks of giving them to their children whilst they are still too young."
