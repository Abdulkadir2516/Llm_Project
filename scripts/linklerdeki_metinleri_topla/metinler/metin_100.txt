This article is more than 2 months old
Northern Ireland MP Sorcha Eastwood told the House of Commons how she was targeted by Andrew Tate and his followers for speaking out against Elon Musk online. Eastwood spoke to MPs during a debate on digital platforms' impact on democracy in which she shared her own experience with online hate and death threats.
