A sixth of online harassment victims are children
Thousands of schoolchildren have been given a lesson on keeping safe online by two tech giants.
More than 20,000 children have been given advice in a lesson delivered by Tech She Can in partnership with the Royal Air Force Charitable Trust (RAFCT), based in Fairford.
The live lesson was developed by the Cheltenham-headquartered GCHQ, and the National Cyber Security Centre, and streamed leading up to Safer Internet Day on Tuesday.
The NSPCC said about one in five children aged between 10 and 15 admitted to talking to strangers online.
Technology 'constantly evolving'
The charity also said one in six people who had experienced online harassment were under the age of 18.
Safer Internet Day is the UK's "biggest celebration of online safety", and is now marked in more than 170 countries since launching 20 years ago.
The 40-minute live lesson explored biometrics - such as fingerprint technology - through an animation as well as a Q&A session with cyber security professionals.
Dr Kevin Stenson, director at RAFCT said: "While many children are tech-savvy, technology is constantly evolving.
"That's why partnerships like this are so important in helping us reach and support young learners, particularly those who do not have access to tech at home."
RAFCT is powered by the Royal International Air Tattoo, hosted at RAF Fairford, which is the largest military airshow in the world.
2025 is the second year RAFCT has worked with Tech She Can, with lessons also given on sustainable transport and living in space.
Becky Patel, head of education and learning at Tech She Can, said: "In our Tech for Cyber security lesson the children explore why and how we need to keep our information safe online and the many different people and technology helping us to do this.
"Don't worry if you missed out this time, there will be lots more opportunities to join us live or catch the recording at any time which suits you."
