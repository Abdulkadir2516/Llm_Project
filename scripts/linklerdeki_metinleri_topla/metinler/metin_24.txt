Footballers being supported amid online abuse

Michael Flynn told fans that online trolls had targeted his family members
A football manager has spoken about his club's decision to employ safeguarding experts to work with players in the squad
amid increasing online abuse.
Cheltenham Town's Michael Flynn deleted social media after receiving "horrible stuff" from trolls, and hearing worries for younger players especially, with fans also offered support.
It comes after Ofcom found young adults aged 18 to 24 spend an average of six hours a day online.
Daisy Greenwell, co-founder of Smartphone Free Childhood, said the internet's lack of regulation meant it was "a wild west" for children.
'A load of rubbish'
At a football fan forum last week, Mr Flynn said he was "very fortunate" for social media not to exist during his upbringing, and feels "sorry" for the young people of today.
"Social media, for all its good, it's got a lot of nasty heads," he said.
"That's one of the reasons why I hate it when I get asked a question on social media, it means [the troll] is probably in the pub misbehaving... and didn't watch the game.
"They've seen the result and they go on and post a load of rubbish.
"I've had some horrible stuff said about me, about family; I've come off and I'm not giving them the time of day."

Mr Flynn said there's "there's always somebody" players can talk to if they are affected by online abuse
Mr Flynn said the club offers "an avenue" to anyone seeking support after receiving online abuse.
"There's always somebody within us who are willing to listen to you and and try and help in any way we can," he told fans.
Ofcom found one in five children in the UK aged between eight and 15 have lied about their age to access social media.
Ms Greenwell said some parents have discovered their child is part of a 5,000 member Whatsapp group.
"It just quickly degenerates into horrible, toxic, bullying, racism, misogyny, videos of beheadings, all sorts of things like that," she said.
"Kids just aren't ready to deal with that digital way of socialising, so if we can keep them off it for as long as possible, until they're a little bit better at it... [that's] the best thing parents can do."
