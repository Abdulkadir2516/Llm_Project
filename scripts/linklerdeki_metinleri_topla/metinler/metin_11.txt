Falkirk councillor felt 'physically sick' after threats over council tax rise
The councillor who introduced Scotland's biggest council tax rise this year has received violent threats over the decision.
Laura Murtagh, who sits as an independent on Falkirk Council,
told the BBC's Scotcast podcast she had suffered "overwhelming" online abuse
since putting forward a motion for a 15.6% increase last week.
Some messages said the councillor should get "a kicking" for the proposal, while other abuse came from people Ms Murtagh knows personally.
However, she defended the increase and said it would help protect education services in the area.
