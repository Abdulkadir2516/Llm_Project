Everton have strongly condemned the “threatening, racist, and misogynistic abuse” aimed at Dominic Calvert-Lewin’s wife on social media and are working with Merseyside police to identify the culprits.
The Everton striker’s wife, Sandra, was targeted after posting her support for Calvert-Lewin after the
farewell to Goodison Park
on Sunday and suggesting his efforts are underappreciated. Calvert-Lewin, 28, is out of contract at the end of the season but has been offered new terms.

In a statement the club said it “strongly condemns the threatening, racist, and misogynistic abuse directed towards the wife of Dominic Calvert-Lewin on social media”, adding: “This sinister and intimidating behaviour is not only deeply hurtful and distressing, it is also criminal – and does not represent the values of Everton or the overwhelming majority of our supporters.
“The club has a zero-tolerance policy towards all forms of discriminatory and abusive behaviour. We are working closely with Merseyside police and the Premier League to ensure the individuals responsible are identified and held accountable for their actions. We will continue to offer our full support to Dominic and his family.”
Abdoulaye Doucouré is to leave Everton when his contract expires at the end of the season. The 32-year-old midfielder has been an important figure under David Moyes and Sean Dyche, scoring the goal
that preserved Everton’s top-flight status against Bournemouth
in 2023, but confirmed on Tuesday that he would be leaving as a free agent.
Everton had offered Doucouré a new deal, having declined to take up an option to extend his contract by 12 months, but that was rejected. The Mali international had voiced frustration at the lack of an offer from Everton in recent weeks and is believed to have several options on the table, including from the Saudi Pro League. Leeds have also been linked with the former Watford midfielder.
Doucouré moved to Everton from Vicarage Road for £20m almost five years ago and has made 165 appearances for the club, scoring 21 goals. He waved goodbye to all sides of Goodison Park when substituted in the win against Southampton on Sunday and was in tears on the players’ lap of honour.
Moyes said: “Doucs has been an influential player throughout his time at the club, including since I returned as manager, and Evertonians will always be grateful for his dedication and crucial goals. Everyone at Everton thanks Doucs for his service and wishes him all the best for the future.”

Doucouré’s final Everton appearance could come at Newcastle on Sunday. He will join Ashley Young and the goalkeepers Asmir Begovic and João Virgínia in leaving when their contracts expire this summer.
“Everton means a lot to me,” Doucouré said. “Obviously the past five years have been hard. I will always remember my time as a dream for me to play for Everton Football Club. Obviously, I’m sad to leave the club but I think the time has come for a new chapter for me and the club as well and I will always be grateful for what the club did for me.
“My best memory will obviously be the goal I scored against Bournemouth to keep the club in the Premier League. I think this is something I’ll always be proud of. It was a wonderful moment for me and my family, and for the club as well.”
