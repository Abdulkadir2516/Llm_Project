The Guides were taught critical thinking and leadership skills at the event
Guides from across the county learned about modern policing and earned their police challenge badges at an interaction day organised by Wiltshire Police.
It was the second event of its type organised by the police force, with more than 100 Guides and Brownies taking part on Sunday.
Among the activities were teamwork and problem-solving exercises, including the opportunity to "solve" a crime.
The event aimed to build critical thinking and leadership skills, while also allowing the police force to hear the concerns of young people.
The guides were given "beer goggles" to wear, which simulated the experience of drunkenness
To earn their badge, the Guides had to complete a series of activities including learning about police clothing and equipment and designing their own police force.
BBC Radio Wiltshire's Kelly Morgan asked the Guides taking part for their thoughts on the day.
"It is very inspiring as obviously you see how it all works officially and you can actually meet and speak with some of the officers," said one attendee.
"I really liked it when we went did the escape challenge. I love finding out the clues," added another.
When asked about whether she would consider joining the police force, 14-year-old Hannah said she "would love to".
"I just want to solve the crimes that haven't been solved. I feel like I need that challenge in my life," she added.
Chief Constable of Wiltshire Police, Catherine Roper, was in attendance
Wiltshire Police's Chief Constable Catherine Roper expressed her enthusiasm for the outreach event.
"There's a lot of excited girl guides, there's also a lot of excited people from Wiltshire Police, because we have representatives from all parts of the service here today, police officers, staff and volunteers," she said.
She said it was insightful event for the police, adding: "I picked up that the girls are a little bit worried about being out and about late at night, there was a very strong theme around anti-social behaviour, combatting drug use and illegal vape use and then also the online cyber bullying space.
"In terms of what they want from policing, they [told us they] want more visibility and probably want more events like this, where we get to spend time with them and talk to them in a different way."
On completing all three events, the guides were presented with their badges at a ceremony lead by Chief Constable Roper.
The force say they will run a similar event for local Scout groups in the autumn.
